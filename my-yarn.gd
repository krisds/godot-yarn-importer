extends "res://yarn/yarn-importer.gd"

# An example extended class of "yarn-importer"
#
# It is recommended you create your own based on this example.
#
# It is easier to just tie "yarn-importer" directly into your scene,
#  but in time you will likely reuse this class many times, 
#  and it can grow overly complicated merged in your scene
# You might also have multiple types of story GUIs, 
#  then you'd want one of these for each type of GUI
