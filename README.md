# godot-yarn-importer

A Yarn Importer for Godot 3.2+

Based on:
- Yarn: https://github.com/InfiniteAmmoInc/Yarn

The focus of this is to provide a GDScript library that reads ".yarn.txt" files from Yarn, then imports it into a data structure useful for Godot developers.  Convienience functions and an example are included but the GUI portion of the import is up to *you*, the developer.  Whether you want basic 2D, animated 2D, 3D controls, or whatever, you are responsible for the look and feel and you must choose the components used to create the GUI. A basic vanilla dialog+choice GUI is provided only as an example.
